# Poject Overview
When we moved from Asia to the Midwest, we started noticing how outdoor culture shapes brand identity. So, for our Social Media Analysis final project, we compared two outdoor giants — Patagonia and Arc'teryx — on Twitter.

# Methodology
We used **R** to conduct data mining, sentiment analysis, and network visualization.

# Key Finding
We found that Patagonia’s strength lies in value-driven storytelling and grassroots engagement,while Arc'teryx thrives on influencer culture and performance branding.

# Takeaway
Brands that stay authentic to their values build stronger communities than those chasing visibility.
